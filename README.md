This is the repo for my personal site. Pretty straightforward. Trying to not make it some standard bootstrap theme so I took
some of the more intense bootstrap templates off the table completely. Transitions are done with plain CSS, Skrollr will be implemented
eventually to achieve some parallax effects and enable smother scrolling as anchor points are jumped to. Contact form emails me directly.
